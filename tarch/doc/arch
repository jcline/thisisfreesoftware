The theoretical architecture is a simple processor core. It has the following
specifications:

- 128 64-bit general purpose integer registers (cannot be modified)
   - Upper 23 registers are used for various things such as false, true, 
- Total of 23 instructions
  - All instructions are predicated
  - No immediate mode instructions all instructions (with the exception of two)
    operate using registers.
  - Instructions are 64-bits in length 
  - Little endian (no attempt made to work on big endian systems)
- Von-neuman architecture (this will probably change to harvard in the future)
- No support for floating point instructions at this point (will most likely
  be added in the future)

Instruction Reference

Foreward:
   There are only 23 instructions which was a conscious choice on my part. That
   choice is a side effect of my exposure to the MSP430 architecture. Of the 23
   instructions, there are only two that operate on immediate values. Every
   other instruction uses registers exclusively.
